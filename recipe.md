1. to make the dough, mix water into flour, adding more bit by bit as needed until you can collect everything together in one big mass. Knead until the dough is soft and smooth for about 10-15 minutes. Cover and set aside for 20 minutes. Knead again before making the wrappers for the filling.
2. Mix all the filling ingredients in a large bowl. Mix well in hand, adjust for seasoning with salt.
3. For the dough, after a final knead, break off a small ball, roll between palms to form a circle. Dust working surface with flour before continuing.
4. On the working surface gently flatten the ball with your palm to about 2-in circle. Make a few semi-flattened circles, cover with a towel. Use a rolling pin to rollout each flattened
5. Make sure that the middle portion of the wrapper is slightly thicker than the edges to make sure the filling fits perfectly. Hold the edges of the semi-flattened dough with one hand and with the other hand begin rolling the edges of the dough out,swirling a bit at a time. Continue until the wrapper attains 3 inch diameter circular shape. Repeat with the remaining semi-flattened dough circles. Cover with bowl to prevent from drying out.
6. To add the filling hold wrapper on one palm, put one tablespoon of filling mixture and with the other hand bring all edges together to the center, making the pleats. Pinch and twist the pleats to ensure the absolute closure of the filling.
